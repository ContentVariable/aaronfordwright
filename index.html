            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Aaron is a B.A. graduate from VCU, who had a major focus in design
              and theatre carpentry. While his degree initially led him to
              develop skills in production creation, he learned much more from
              the hobbies he developed while at college and over the previous
              years since graduating. During his time at VCU, Aaron spent a lot
              of time at their aptly named “The Workshop” center, where he
              recorded his own podcast and learned basic graphic design. In the
              years since, he has taught himself JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and
              hopes to be CompTIA certified within the next 3 months. IT work is
              an extreme passion of his, that while it only sort of flourished
              during college, definitely came to bloom when he found the time to
              really dig into the latent fire I had for it since leaving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aaron’s biggest strength is his firm belief in really listening to
              people and correctly assessing their situation. Oversight in what
              someone may be asking for assistance for may lead to more issues
              than there had been before. It is important to pay attention to
              things that may even be beyond the scope of what your employee,
              manager, or customer may be inquiring about. This has helped him
              countless times as he has been able to properly solve a problem
              that may have otherwise been handled ineffectively. A common
              occurrence while in his productions at VCU, that was mitigated by
              quick collective group thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, Aaron is progressing his expertise by learning new
              languages and expanding upon that of which he already knows. He
              plans on progressing through Node.js, React, and Python by the end
              of the year. With these languages and front-end knowledge in
              possession, Aaron has a goal of creating numerous beautiful
              websites with seamless controls that work for every user. And as
              for the future, he plans on eventually moving into software design
              for more in-depth programming.
